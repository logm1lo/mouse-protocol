# Razer hardware test checklist

Test in Chrome or Edge over HTTPS. Quit Razer Synapse first — it holds the
control interface open and reads then time out.

On macOS the browser itself must be granted Input Monitoring permission
(System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring) **before** the first
connection, and then quit and reopened. Razer's control interface is a Generic
Desktop Mouse collection, which macOS reserves for its own input stack; without
the permission the browser's `IOHIDDeviceOpen` call is refused and the app
shows "Failed to open the device." while the device still appears in the
picker. This is a system grant, not an app setting.

Identifiers verified on hardware:

- `1532:00a4` — Mouse Dock Pro (settings passthrough; verified with Naga V2 Pro)
- `1532:00a5` — Viper V2 Pro, wired
- `1532:00a6` — Viper V2 Pro, Stock receiver
- `1532:00a7` — Naga V2 Pro, wired (firmware 1.3)
- `1532:00a8` — Naga V2 Pro, stock HyperSpeed receiver
- `1532:00c0` — Viper V3 Pro, wired
- `1532:00c1` — Viper V3 Pro, HyperSpeed receiver
- `1532:008a` — Viper Mini, wired (separate driver)
- `1532:00b8` — Viper V3 HyperSpeed, stock HyperSpeed receiver
- `1532:00a3` — Cobra, wired (separate driver)

Mouse Dock Pro uses the same 90-byte protocol as the paired mouse. It has no
fixed polling list: if the paired mouse answers the extended polling command it
offers up to 8000 Hz; otherwise it stays on the 1 kHz ladder (Naga V2 Pro). The
DPI ceiling is pinned to the paired Naga V2 Pro (30000); a higher 35k dock path
has not been hardware-tested. Quit Razer services before probing — they can
return unrelated `0x0f/0x03` feature reports.

Naga V2 Pro hardcodes 125/500/1000 Hz on both the cable and the stock receiver.

Claimed but never connected:

- `1532:006e` — DeathAdder Essential, wired
- `1532:0071` — DeathAdder Essential White Edition, wired
- `1532:0098` — DeathAdder Essential (2021), wired
- `1532:0084` — DeathAdder V2, wired
- 96 further products from the OpenRazer reference

These three shipped with the driver long before the registry existed and were
listed here as supported, but the section below has always described them as not
hardware-tested. See [Untested models](#untested-models) before testing any of
them.

Razer does not declare its control channel in the HID descriptor, so no
interface advertises a feature report. The exchange still works because WebHID
does not check report IDs against the descriptor. The interface that answers is
the one whose **only** collection is Generic Desktop Mouse (`usagePage 0x01`,
`usage 0x02`).

The mouse presents four interfaces on each connection. The vendor filter
narrows the picker to one of them when wired, and to two on the receiver, where
a second interface carries a mouse collection alongside others. Both are named
`Razer Viper V3 Pro` and cannot be told apart in the picker, so on the receiver
the first choice may be the interface that never answers. It is then skipped in
the device list; add the device again and choose the other entry.

The cable and the receiver are separate devices with separate product IDs, so
each needs its own browser permission. Granting one does not grant the other,
and switching between them the first time means adding the device again.

DPI, polling rate, idle sleep and the low power threshold can be written. Every
other control is withheld because no command for it has been confirmed.

1. Connect the mouse over the cable and confirm the model, wired state, battery,
   charging state, DPI, and polling rate are correct.
2. Repeat on the receiver. Battery should read a plausible level, charging
   should read false, and the polling rate should match Synapse.
3. Confirm the reported polling rate tracks a change made in Synapse on both
   connections, including an 8000 Hz setting on the receiver.
4. Change the DPI and confirm the pointer speed changes with it, then reload and
   confirm the new value persisted.
5. Change the polling rate on each connection and confirm it persists. The cable
   offers 125/500/1000 and the receiver adds 2000/4000/8000; no other rate
   should appear.
6. On the receiver, confirm the lift-off card supports both Single and
   Asymmetric modes; on the cable, confirm it stays hidden if class `0x0b` is
   unsupported. Confirm no sensor processing card or receiver signal card appears.
7. Change the auto sleep timeout **on the cable and again on the receiver**,
   reloading each time to confirm the new value persisted. Unlike polling, both
   transports answer `0x07`/`0x83`, so the card belongs on both.
8. Set an off-list timeout in Synapse (7 minutes, say) and confirm the dropdown
   offers and selects it rather than falling back to a value the mouse is not
   holding. Values outside 30 s–15 min are not added to the list, because the
   driver would refuse to write them back.
9. Confirm the low power percentage matches what Synapse shows **before**
   changing it — the read is what proves the 0–255 scale is being decoded
   correctly. Then change it, reload, and confirm it persisted. At 2000 Hz and
   above the dropdown should be disabled with a note, not hidden.
10. Leave the panel open for a few minutes and confirm the background refresh
    keeps reporting without stalling or throwing.
11. Record the device identifier, firmware version, and any failing setting in
    the issue or pull request.

## Viper V3 HyperSpeed (`1532:00b8`) — verified on the stock receiver

Battery, DPI read/write, lift-off distance and sleep timeout all behaved. One
entry in the registry was wrong and is now corrected:

**The stock HyperSpeed receiver rejects the extended polling command**
(`0x00`/`0x40`, a divisor of 8000) as unsupported, and answers only the legacy
divisor-of-1000 one. 125, 500 and 1000 Hz were each written and read back
successfully after `highRatePolling` was set to `false`.

This is the first product to show that `highRatePolling` is genuinely per-PID.
It cannot be inferred from either of the obvious rules:

| Rule you might infer | Counter-example |
| --- | --- |
| "wireless ⇒ extended command" | `0x00b8` is wireless and refuses it |
| "1000 Hz ceiling ⇒ legacy command" | `0x00a6` tops out at 1000 Hz and uses the extended one |

Both are wireless receivers advertising the same three rates, and they disagree,
so this field has to be settled per product and must not be tidied onto a group
default. `devices.test.ts` pins the pair against exactly that.

Still untested on this model: the asymmetric lift-off pair. `asymmetricLiftOff`
stays `false`, so the mode probe — which is a *write* — is never sent and the
mouse keeps the plain three-stop tracking control. The reported lift-off
behaviour is that control, not the pair.

## Basilisk X HyperSpeed (`1532:0083`) — a command that answers without existing

Reported: every lift-off level failed, two different ways.

| Level | Sent | Reply | Message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Medium | `00 04 01 01` | `0x02` OK, args echoed | "kept Low tracking distance instead of Medium" |
| High | `00 04 01 02` | `0x05` unsupported | "Class 0x0b command 0x0b is not supported" |

The mouse has no class `0x0b` lift-off. What made it look as though it did is
the **read**: `0x0b`/`0x85` answers status `0x02` with an all-zero payload, on
every call, and `decodeLiftOff` maps `args[2] = 0` to a perfectly legitimate
**"Low"**. The driver offered the control because the read succeeded.

There is no reply that separates "no lift-off control" from "Low at the bottom
of the range" — `0` is a valid level — so this cannot be probed and is now a
per-product `liftOff` flag, off unless a hardware report turned it on. It also
saves `0x0b` a round trip on every background refresh for the 102 products that
do not have it.

**This is the third capability that could not be probed**, after
`highRatePolling` and `asymmetricLiftOff`. The pattern is worth stating plainly:
a Razer mouse answering a command is not evidence it implements it. Firmware
acknowledges commands it ignores, and returns zeroed payloads that decode as
valid values. Any future capability must default off and be turned on by a
hardware report.

The same capture also showed the battery level (`0x07`/`0x80` → `0x35`, 21%)
being discarded because the charging query (`0x07`/`0x84`) is unsupported on
this model and took the whole read down with it. The two are now read
independently; an unreadable charging state reports `Unknown` rather than
costing the level.

## DeathAdder V3 Pro (`1532:00b6`) — open: a write that confirms but may not apply

Reported: polling rate, low power mode and auto sleep "don't flash into the
mouse", yet changing them in Razer's own software does show up here.

The capture does not support a bug in the write path. Across 80 events and 252
reports there were **zero failures**, and every write was confirmed by a
separate read of the paired getter:

| Set | Wrote | Read back | Still reading, 20 min later |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Polling 125 Hz | `00`/`05` `[08]` | `00`/`85` → `08` | `08` |
| Low power 5% | `07`/`01` `[0d 00]` | `07`/`81` → `0d 00` | `0d 00` |
| Auto sleep 300 s | `07`/`03` `[01 2c]` | `07`/`83` → `01 2c` | `01 2c` |

Transaction id `0x1f` is right, the bytes match OpenRazer's `set_polling_rate`,
`set_idle_time` and `set_low_battery_threshold`, and `decodeRazerResponse`
checked class and id on every reply. So if the reporter is right, **the register
that answers is not the register that governs the hardware** — the Basilisk X
lesson one level deeper: reading back what you wrote is not proof it applied.

### Polling: resolved on the receiver (`1532:00b7`)

A second capture, on the receiver rather than the cable, wrote 500, 125 and
1000 Hz on the extended command (`0x00`/`0x40`) and read every one back from
`0x00`/`0xc0` correctly — while the **measured** report rate stayed at 1000 Hz
throughout.

`0x00b7` is the stock HyperSpeed receiver, whose ceiling is 1000 Hz. The 8000 Hz
HyperPolling Wireless Dongle is a different device (`0x00b3`) that this driver
does not claim, so a mouse reaching us on this product id is never on one. The
extended encoding expresses the rate as a divisor of 8000, so it was addressing
a range this hardware does not have; the firmware stored the value and kept
running at 1000. `highRatePolling` is now `false` here, which sends the legacy
command and its divisor of 1000 — enough for every rate the stock receiver can
actually reach.

Two things this does **not** settle:

- `0x00c3` is the same model on a second product id and inherits
  `MODERN_RECEIVER` unchanged. Likely the same, unmeasured.
- Six other products still pair `highRatePolling: true` with a 1000 Hz ceiling
  (`0x007b`, `0x007d`, `0x00a8`, `0x00ab`, `0x00b0`, `0x00c3`), and so does
  `0x00a6`, which is marked verified. The 499 Hz `pointerrawupdate` measurement
  below belongs to the Viper V3 Pro (`0x00c1`) on a genuinely 8K-capable
  dongle — no measurement covers `0x00a6`, so it should not be read as proof
  that the extended command works on a 1000 Hz receiver.

**Read-back is not measurement.** That is the fourth capability to confirm
itself and do nothing, after `highRatePolling` on `0x00b8`, `asymmetricLiftOff`,
and `liftOff` on `0x0083`.

### Sleep and low power: still open

Both were written and read back cleanly on both transports, and neither can be
observed while the mouse is on a cable. Two mechanisms still fit:

1. **No commit step.** DPI writes carry a storage selector (`RAZER_STORAGE`);
   these two carry none, so the value may sit in volatile state the getter
   faithfully echoes.
2. **Contention.** Two replies arrived carrying an earlier command's id and a
   transaction id the host never sent (`0x10`, `0x14`), and latency went from
   ~100 ms to ~1000 ms mid-session. Something else was on the wire.

To tell them apart: set auto sleep, power-cycle the mouse, and re-read with the
vendor software closed — a value that reverts means 1. Then repeat with the
vendor software and its background service fully quit — a value that now holds
means 2. Do not guess between them; picking wrong ships another silent no-op.

Note that auto sleep and low power do nothing while the mouse is on a cable, so
the vendor software displaying a stale value for those two is not evidence
either way; it keeps its own copy and pushes it down.

Fixed from the same capture: a reply belonging to the previous command used to
fail that read outright. Re-reading cannot recover it — nothing new arrives
until the host asks again — so getters now re-issue the request, and setters
still refuse to repeat themselves.

## Transaction ids, audited against OpenRazer

A hardware report on the Viper Ultimate (`1532:007b`) found `0x1f` silent where
`0x3f` read firmware, DPI, polling and battery correctly. Auditing the whole
registry against the id OpenRazer's `razer_attr_read_firmware_version()` selects
found **26 of 107 products wrong**, because the id had been inherited from the
transport preset.

The id does not follow the transport group, the connection, the model's age or
its marketing family. Within a single group all three values occur:

| Product | Group | Id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basilisk `0x0064` | standard | `0x3f` |
| Basilisk V2 `0x0085` | standard | `0x1f` |
| Basilisk X HyperSpeed `0x0083` | new-receiver | `0xff` |
| Lancehead Wireless `0x006f` | new-receiver | `0x3f` |
| Pro Click `0x0077` | new-receiver | `0x1f` |

It is now a flat per-product list in `devices.ts`, checked against a full
transcription of the reference in `devices.test.ts`. A wrong id produces silence
rather than an error, so there is no failure mode to catch an inherited guess —
this is why it is not a preset field.

Be clear about how strong that check is. Both lists were transcribed from one
reading of the driver, so a misreading is in both and the test cannot see it.
The test catches drift and forces divergences to be declared; it is not
independent confirmation. Only connecting a mouse gives that, which is why
these products stay `verified: false` regardless of how carefully the id was
transcribed.

Two divergences from OpenRazer are deliberate and listed in
`EXPECTED_DIVERGENCE`:

- **Viper Ultimate `0x007a`/`0x007b`** — OpenRazer sends `0xff` on every command
  for both ids; the hardware report has `0x3f` working. Observed behaviour wins.
  The mouse may accept both, so **re-testing against `0xff` would settle it**.
- **DeathAdder Essential `0x006e`/`0x0071`/`0x0098`** — the driver has always
  sent `0x3f` on the stated grounds that OpenRazer does, which the driver source
  does not bear out: it lists all three under `0xff`. Untested either way, so it
  was left alone rather than changed blind. **Next thing to check on this
  family.**

### Known limitation: OpenRazer varies the id per command

`RazerProduct.transactionId` is one value per product, and for some models that
is not enough. OpenRazer selects the id per command, and these disagree with
themselves:

| Product | Divergence |
| --- | --- |
| Lancehead Wireless `0x006f`/`0x0070` | firmware/serial/polling/DPI `0x3f`, battery `0x1f` |
| Basilisk Ultimate `0x0086`/`0x0088` | firmware/DPI/polling-write `0x1f`, polling-read `0xff` |
| Mamba Elite `0x006c` | firmware/DPI `0x1f`, serial/polling `0xff` |

The registry uses the firmware-read id, since that read gates everything else.
The consequence is that the commands listed above may fail on those three
models. It degrades rather than breaking: battery and serial are already
optional reads, and the polling read falls back to the other encoding. Supporting
this properly needs a per-command override, which is not implemented.

## Untested models

`devices.ts` claims 100 further products taken from OpenRazer's supported-device
table. They reuse the commands verified above; what the table records per model
is which of those commands are valid, which transaction id the mouse answers on,
and what its sensor and radio can do. **None has been connected**, so each is a
prediction until someone reports otherwise. The panel says so: the connection
card reads `… · untested model`.

The Viper V3 HyperSpeed result above is worth reading before testing one: the
first model connected had a wrong `highRatePolling`, so expect that field to be
the most likely thing to need correcting. It presents as the polling rate
refusing to change while everything else works.

Testing one is worth doing and is low-risk, because every failure mode here is
loud rather than silent:

| If this is wrong | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction id | The mouse never replies. The status read fails on firmware and the panel reports a connection failure. Nothing is written. |
| Interface choice | Same — the wrong interface never answers. Add the device again and pick another entry. |
| A capability flag | The command is not sent at all. The control is missing, not broken. |
| DPI or rate ceiling | The write is refused, or fails its read-back and reports what the mouse kept. |

What is deliberately **not** attempted on an untested model:

- The asymmetric lift-off mode probe, which is a *write*. It stays off unless
  `asymmetricLiftOff` is set, which only the four Viper V2/V3 Pro ids have. An
  untested mouse that answers class `0x0b` still gets the plain three-stop
  tracking control, which costs reads only.
- Lighting, button mapping and macros. The generic driver implements none of
  them for any model — the only lighting controls anywhere in this project are
  the dedicated Cobra and Viper Mini drivers.

To promote a model to verified:

1. Work through the numbered checklist above for it.
2. Confirm the model name, connection type and firmware read at all — that alone
   proves the transaction id and the interface.
3. Check DPI and polling **against Synapse before writing anything**, then
   change each, reload, and confirm it persisted.
4. Correct the model's row in `devices.ts`, set `verified: true`, add its id to
   the verified list at the top of this file and to `VERIFIED` in
   `devices.test.ts`, and record the firmware version in the pull request.

Three groups from the OpenRazer list are excluded on purpose, and adding them
needs new transport work rather than a table row:

- **`legacy/old`** — Orochi 2011 `0x0013`, DeathAdder 3.5G `0x0016` and `0x0029`.
  These predate the 90-byte report and use direct USB control writes, so this
  driver could only ever time out on them.
- **Orochi V2 Bluetooth `0x0095`** — a Bluetooth HID path is not the USB control
  channel and must not be assumed to take the same reports.
- **HyperPolling Wireless Dongle `0x00b3`** is now present as an unverified
  receiver transport. OpenRazer's two-step extended polling write is
  implemented, but its WebHID collection shape and real 8 kHz application still
  need an OpenMouse hardware capture before the entry can be marked verified.

The `index3` models (Naga X `0x0096`, Basilisk V3 `0x0099`, Basilisk V3 35K
`0x00cb`) are the least certain of those that *are* claimed: OpenRazer reaches
them through USB control-transfer index 3, and WebHID cannot select a `wIndex`.
The picker offers every interface instead, so the right one has to be found by
trying them. If none answers, that is worth recording — it would mean these need
a native helper rather than a driver fix.

### Viper V3 Pro SE (`1532:00de` wired, `1532:00df` wireless) — added from the reference, never connected

Added from `RAZER_VIPER_V3_PRO_SE_DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md`, which is itself built
on OpenRazer PR **#2818** — a pull request, not merged driver source. That is
weaker provenance than the rest of the table and the entries should be read that
way. The PR implements the SE by subclassing the Viper V3 Pro classes, so the
packet format, DPI pair (`04/05`, `04/85`), extended polling pair (`00/40`,
`00/c0`) and transaction id `0x1f` all come from `0x00c0`/`0x00c1` at the source
rather than from a family-name guess.

What is *not* inherited from the V3 Pro, and why:

| Field | SE | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verified` | `false` | The V3 Pro's flag was earned by a hardware report on its own product ids. |
| `liftOff` | `false` | Cannot be probed — a mouse without the feature answers `0x0b`/`0x85` with status `0x02` and zeros, which decodes as a legitimate "Low". |
| `asymmetricLiftOff` | `false` | The mode probe is a *write*, and stays off until the command is confirmed on hardware. |

### What a `0x00df` capture settled (firmware "Mouse 1.0", stock HyperSpeed receiver)

**Polling — resolved, and against the reference.** The row shipped with
`RATES_8K` because OpenRazer's SE wireless class exposes it. On hardware:

| Read | Reply |
| --- | --- |
| extended `0x00`/`0xc0` | status `0x05` — **not supported** |
| legacy `0x00`/`0x85` | status `0x02`, divisor `0x01` → 1000 Hz |

That is an outright refusal rather than a write that confirms and does nothing,
so unlike `0x00b7` it needed no rate measurement to settle. `0x00df` is now
`RATES_1K` with `highRatePolling: false`. The 8 kHz ceiling belongs to the
HyperPolling dongle, which is a separate receiver with its own product id — the
panel had been offering four rates the receiver cannot reach.

**Transaction id `0x1f` — confirmed.** Inferred from PR #2818 subclassing the
Viper V3 Pro; every exchange in the capture used `0x1f` and was answered. A wrong
id is silent, so this could not have read at all if it were wrong.

**Control interface — confirmed as the plain mouse collection.** The reference's
descriptor dump suggested the config path might be on a non-pointer interface.
It is not: the driver opened `usage 0x1:2` and it answered. The other reads all
returned sensible values — firmware `01 00` → 1.0, battery `00 FD` → 99%, DPI
`06 40` → 1600, idle `03 84` → 900 s, low battery `0D` → 5%.

Still open:

1. **Every write.** The capture is reads only — no setting was changed, so
   nothing here promotes the model to `verified`. That needs the numbered
   checklist above: write DPI, polling and idle timeout, reload, confirm each
   persisted.
2. **The wired PID `0x00de`.** Untried in a browser; the PR's own smoke test
   only ever covered `0x00df`.
3. **Whether the narrowed filter is now worth adding.** `vendors.ts` still
   requests the whole device for both ids, and `vendorControlInterface: true`
   is still set. Now that `0x1:2` is known to answer on the wireless id, the
   pair could join `RAZER_VIPER_V3_CONTROL_FILTERS` — but `0x00de` has not been
   seen, and narrowing on one id's evidence is what this file exists to prevent.

Not claimed, and not to be guessed: button remapping, Hypershift, macros and
surface calibration. The SE has no Chroma, so no lighting control applies.

## Models Chrome may not be able to reach at all

Reported on the Viper Ultimate dongle: **every** collection came back
`feat[none]`, including the Generic Desktop Mouse interface, whose reports
Chrome stripped as protected. `sendFeatureReport` then fails whatever the
transaction id is, and the mouse could only be driven through the native OS HID
API.

This is worth separating from the ordinary Razer situation, which looks similar
and is not the same thing. Razer never declares the control report in its
descriptor, so `feat[none]` is normal and expected — the Viper V3 Pro reads and
writes fine in that state, because WebHID does not validate report IDs against
the descriptor. What is different here is Chrome *removing* the reports from a
protected collection, which no transaction id or interface choice can work
around.

If that holds up, the affected models need the native/HAL transport rather than
a driver fix, and their registry entries are unreachable in the browser however
correct they are. Two things would establish the boundary:

1. Whether it is specific to this device, or to Chrome's handling of a device
   whose only candidate interface is a protected mouse collection.
2. Whether any product currently claimed by the registry shares that shape.

Until then the entries stay: they are correct data, they cost nothing but a
picker row, and a model that cannot be opened fails at `open()` with a clear
browser error rather than doing anything harmful.

### Viper V3 Pro — "failed to write feature report"

A Viper V3 Pro (`0x00c0` wired, `0x00c1` receiver) has been reported stopping on
Chrome's bare DOMException message "Failed to write feature report." — the same
string as the protected-collection case above, on a model whose control
interface is otherwise confirmed working. The first control command (the
firmware read) hits the refused write first, so the whole status read aborts
with no explanation. Work through the ordinary causes before blaming the
protected collection:

1. **Razer Synapse is running.** It holds the control interface and the write is
   refused. Quit it and try again — this is by far the most common cause.
2. **Wrong interface granted** on the `0x00c1` receiver. The two picker rows look
   identical and the pointer collection refuses control writes; re-add the
   device and pick the other row. On the cable there is only the one interface.
3. **macOS Input Monitoring** — allow the browser under System Settings → Privacy
   & Security → Input Monitoring, then re-add the device.
4. Otherwise it is the protected-collection case above: capture the device's WebHID
   `collections` dump and the exact error, and it needs the native/HAL transport.

The driver now surfaces these steps in the read error instead of the bare
browser string, so a repeat of this report should carry enough to tell cause 4
apart from causes 1–3.

## DeathAdder Essential — not yet hardware-tested

This model shares the 90-byte protocol above, so it reuses the same commands.
Three things differ, and each is the kind of thing that fails loudly rather
than quietly:

| Difference | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transaction id | `0x3f`, not `0x1f` | OpenRazer uses the older id for this family. A wrong id means the mouse never replies at all, so this shows up as a timeout, not as a wrong setting. |
| DPI ceiling | 6,400 | Officially published. Anything above is rejected before it reaches the mouse. |
| Battery | none | The battery commands are skipped rather than sent and caught, because an unsupported reply would abort the whole status read. |

The control interface is also less certain than on the Viper. That one always
answers on the interface whose only collection is Generic Desktop Mouse; this
family splits pointer and configuration across separate interfaces and the
revisions disagree about which usage page carries the configuration one, so the
driver accepts a vendor-defined collection as well. The picker will therefore
offer more than one entry. If the first never answers, add the device again and
choose another — the same situation as the Viper receiver.

1. Confirm the picker offers the mouse at all. If Chrome grants only a single
   Generic Desktop Mouse collection and the firmware read times out on every
   entry, this platform does not expose the configuration interface and no
   browser-side control is possible. Stop and record that.
2. Confirm the model name, **Wired**, and a firmware version appear.
3. Confirm no battery row appears.
4. Confirm the DPI presets offer 400 / 800 / 1600 / 3200 / 6400, and no 8000.
5. Confirm the polling buttons offer only 125 / 500 / 1000.
6. Read DPI and compare against Synapse **before** writing anything.
7. Change DPI, confirm the pointer speed changes, then reload and confirm it
   persisted. Settings on this model may be volatile — if the value reverts
   after a replug, that is a device trait, not a driver bug.
8. Change the polling rate and verify it externally.
9. Confirm no lift-off buttons and no sensor processing card appear.

If step 6 returns an implausible DPI, the storage byte is the first thing to
try: this driver uses `VARSTORE` (`0x01`) for both the read and the write,
matching OpenRazer's generic path, but some older models expect `NOSTORE`
(`0x00`). Change `RAZER_STORAGE` only after confirming it against a capture.

Lighting is not implemented. The hardware is fixed-colour (green on the black
edition, white on the white one), the panel has no Razer lighting controls, and
the effect packets are unverified. Device mode (`0x00`/`0x04`) is never sent —
driver mode changes button behaviour and would need restoring on disconnect.

## DeathAdder V2 — not yet hardware-tested

This model shares the Essential family's transaction id (`0x3f`) and interface
layout, so it reuses the same driver. Two things differ from the Essential:

| Difference | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DPI ceiling | 20,000 | OpenRazer's `DPI_MAX` for this model. |
| DPI store byte | `NOSTORE` (`0x00`) | OpenRazer groups this model with the V2 generation, which reads and writes DPI through the no-store byte rather than the storage byte (`0x01`) the Essential and the V3 Pro use. A wrong store reads back an implausible DPI, so this fails loudly, not quietly. |

The control interface split is the same as the Essential's, so the same advice
applies: the picker may offer more than one entry, and if the first never
answers, add the device again and choose another.

1. Confirm the picker offers the mouse at all. If Chrome grants only a single
   Generic Desktop Mouse collection and the firmware read times out on every
   entry, this platform does not expose the configuration interface and no
   browser-side control is possible. Stop and record that.
2. Confirm the model name, **Wired**, and a firmware version appear.
3. Confirm no battery row appears.
4. Confirm the DPI presets offer 100 through 20,000, and no 20,001.
5. Confirm the polling buttons offer only 125 / 500 / 1000.
6. Read DPI and compare against Synapse **before** writing anything. A value off
   by a known factor — 0, or a wildly different DPI — means the store byte is
   wrong; the read-before-write check is what separates a store problem from a
   write problem.
7. Change DPI, confirm the pointer speed changes, then reload and confirm it
   persisted.
8. Change the polling rate and verify it externally.
9. Confirm no lift-off buttons and no sensor processing card appear.

The V2 has RGB lighting, but like every other model the panel offers no Razer
lighting controls and device mode is never sent.

## DeathAdder V2 on macOS

Confirmed on macOS: the mouse enumerates as four HID interfaces, the
configuration channel sits on the Generic Desktop Mouse interface, and the
browser is refused from opening it unless it holds the Input Monitoring
permission. The device still shows up in the picker, so the failure looks like
a driver bug: the sidebar lists the mouse as available, and connecting fails
with `NotAllowedError: Failed to open the device.` before any feature report is
exchanged — no Synapse installed. Granting the browser Input Monitoring
(System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring) and restarting it is
the fix; the app now says exactly that when the open is refused on macOS.

## Verified against firmware 1.12

| Read | Class / ID | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Firmware | `0x00` / `0x81` | |
| Serial | `0x00` / `0x82` | ASCII, null terminated |
| Battery | `0x07` / `0x80` | level out of 255 |
| Charging | `0x07` / `0x84` | |
| Idle sleep | `0x07` / `0x83` | seconds, big-endian |
| Low power | `0x07` / `0x81` | level out of 255 in the **first** byte, so 77 is 30% |
| DPI | `0x04` / `0x85` | big-endian X and Y |
| DPI stages | `0x04` / `0x86` | seven-byte records; decoded but not yet shown |
| Polling, legacy | `0x00` / `0x85` | divisor of 1000; **wired only** |
| Polling, extended | `0x00` / `0xc0` | divisor of 8000; **receiver only** |

Each write clears the high bit of the matching read.

| Write | Class / ID | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DPI | `0x04` / `0x05` | storage byte, then big-endian X and Y |
| Polling, legacy | `0x00` / `0x05` | divisor of 1000; **wired only** |
| Polling, extended | `0x00` / `0x40` | leading `0x00`, then divisor of 8000 |
| Idle sleep | `0x07` / `0x03` | seconds, big-endian |
| Low power | `0x07` / `0x01` | level out of 255, then trailing `0x00` |

Transaction ID `0x1f` answered every command on both connections. Writes were
confirmed by effect, not only by read-back: a DPI change altered pointer speed,
and a 500 Hz write measured 499 Hz through `pointerrawupdate`.

The cable is limited to 1000 Hz on this model, which is also the ceiling the
legacy encoding can express, so no HyperPolling command is missing there.

## Asymmetric lift-off on firmware 1.14

The asymmetric pair write (`0x0b`/`0x05`) is armed by the unlock
`0x0b`/`0x0b` `00 04 04 01` — the value Synapse sent on firmware 1.12. Firmware
1.14 still accepts it on the swept hardware.

It is not universal. A reporter's Viper V3 Pro (HyperSpeed receiver, "Mouse
1.14") refused the armed pair write with status `0x03` in **two** sessions —
the Sep 5 capture reproduced the Aug 12 one byte-for-byte, so that failure was
unit- or state-related, not the "transient" it was first written off as. The
reporter's unit holds a stale asymmetric pair (26/25) while symmetric "Low" is
active, its unarmed mode-probe pair write is refused on every connect without
moving the stored pair, and the same `04 01` unlock that the sweep verified is
echoed `0x02` before the pair write still comes back `0x03`.

A standalone WebHID sweep over the sensor-setting table on 1.14 (HyperSpeed
receiver) returned:

| Unlock `0x0b/0x0b` | Pair write |
| --- | --- |
| `00 04 04 01` (current code) | `0x02` OK |
| `00 04 04 00` (canonical asymmetric cal) | `0x02` OK |
| `00 04 02 00` / `02 01` / `02 02` (fixed asymmetric) | `0x03` |
| `00 04 06 00` (self-cal) | `0x03` |
| `00 04 03 00` (symmetric cal), `00 04 01 00` (symmetric level) | `0x03` |

The calib-mode-on step (`0x0b`/`0x03` `00 04 01`) before the unlock is not
required on this firmware. Both `04 01` and `04 00` arm the pair write with or
without it, and the fixed/self-cal setting values never do.

`setLiftOff` sends `04 01` first — verified on both 1.12 and 1.14, so the
shipped path is unchanged on units where it works — and when the pair write is
refused with `0x03` falls back in turn to the canonical `04 00` unlock (verified
only on 1.14) and then to the calib-mode-on step followed by `04 01`. A refusal
is safe to burn on either kind of unit: the swept unit answers a refused write
by still moving the stored pair (the reason the read-back verifies), while the
reporter's unit leaves it untouched. Which arm the reporter's unit actually
accepts, if any, still needs a hands-on trial; the fallback chain exists so the
attempt costs one extra click instead of a dead feature.

## Changing the polling rate reconfigures the link

Switching the receiver to 8,000 Hz briefly reconfigures the wireless link, and
feature-report exchanges sent into that window come back with a bad checksum or
not at all. `setPollingRate` pauses 150 ms for the link to settle, and `exchange`
re-sends a request whose reply was corrupt instead of surfacing the checksum
error — so a single garbage reply no longer fails the whole status read or hides
the lift-off card. The read-back budget is unchanged in the healthy case; only a
lost exchange takes the retry path.

## Idle sleep range

Synapse slides from **1 to 15 minutes** in whole minutes, so the dropdown offers
one entry per minute across that range and nothing is interpolated.

The firmware is looser than the vendor software: 30 seconds round-tripped
exactly, with status `0x02`, which is below even the 60 s floor OpenRazer
documents. Neither bound describes what the mouse enforces. The driver follows
Synapse anyway, because a value nothing else offers has no way to be checked
against the vendor behaviour.

A timeout outside 1–15 minutes — set by a sweep script, say — cannot be shown as
a selected option without either rendering the dropdown blank or offering a
value the driver would refuse to write. The card is hidden in that case rather
than displaying a value the mouse is not holding.

## Low power mode

Synapse slides this from **5 to 100 percent**, so the dropdown offers every
fifth percent across that range.

The threshold is stored on the battery level's **0–255 scale, not as a
percentage**: the mouse held `0x4d` — 77 out of 255 — while Synapse displayed
30%. Reading it as a percentage is wrong by a factor of two and a half.

It also answers in the **first** argument byte. Battery (`00 eb`), charging
(`00 00`) and sleep (`00 78`) all pad with a leading zero and answer in the
second, so this command is the exception in its own class — the captured reply
is `4d 00`. Decoding it like its neighbours yields a constant zero, which then
falls below the 5% floor and hides the card rather than showing a wrong number.
Both facts are pinned in `protocol.test.ts`.

The
scale is coarser than whole percent, so every offered value is checked in
`protocol.test.ts` to survive the round trip; one that did not would fail its
read-back and reject a setting the panel had just offered.

Synapse also states that **low power mode is unavailable at 2000 Hz and above**
and greys the slider out there. The threshold still reads at any rate, so the
driver disables the control and explains why rather than hiding it.

The disabled control is not what enforces that rule. The panel repaints from a
status that already includes staged changes, so staging a jump to 4000 Hz greys
the dropdown while a threshold staged a moment earlier still sits in the queue.
`setLowPowerThreshold` therefore reads the rate back from the mouse and refuses
there, where a repaint cannot reach it.

The write mirrors that payload — level first, then a trailing zero — and is
confirmed on hardware: writing 85% left the mouse holding `d9 00`, which
survived a reload and agreed with Synapse. `0xd9` is 217, and 85% encodes to 217
only because 216.75 rounds up, so that capture pins the rounding in both
directions rather than only the byte order.

## Lift-off distance

Not found. Class `0x0b` answers at `0x80`, `0x85`, `0x8b`, `0x8e`, `0x90`–`0x92`,
`0x94`, `0x95` and `0xa4`, and class `0x04` holds only DPI commands, but none
carries the values the vendor software shows. `0x0b`/`0x85` tracks the
asymmetric cut-off toggle in its third byte: `01` symmetric, `02` asymmetric.

The vendor software exposes lift-off as a continuous slider, and asymmetric mode
splits it into separate lift-off and landing values where landing cannot exceed
lift-off. That does not fit the three-value `liftOffDistance` field, so this
needs a richer type before it can be exposed even once the command is found.

## Unresolved

- No lift-off distance command has been found, so no lift-off control is
  offered and `supportedLiftOffDistances` stays empty.
- No sensor processing commands (motion sync, angle snapping, ripple control)
  have been found, so that card stays hidden. The vendor software does not
  expose them for this model either, so they are more likely absent from the
  mouse than missing from this driver.
- No command reports link quality, so the signal-strength card is hidden through
  `ui.hideSignalCard` rather than left rendering its placeholder. This matters
  because it shares a section with the sleep card, which this driver opens.
- The sleep read is answered on both transports, unlike polling. A transport
  that ever stops answering reports no timeout, and the card is hidden for that
  connection instead of failing the whole status read.
- The 35000 DPI ceiling comes from the published sensor specification, not from
  the mouse; the stages read only proves the 400–6400 ladder. A write past the
  real ceiling fails its read-back and reports a mismatch rather than silently
  misreporting, but the ceiling itself is still unconfirmed.
- DPI step granularity is assumed to be 50. Values off that grid are rejected
  before they reach the mouse, so a finer or coarser real step would only mean
  the control offers the wrong choices.
- The DPI stage table (`0x04`/`0x06`) is decoded and tested but never written.
  A wrong length there is the one realistic way to corrupt stored settings.

## Viper Mini (verified on hardware)

The Viper Mini shares the 90-byte report and command ids above, but belongs to
openrazer's legacy transaction group: every command is answered with transaction
id `0xff` rather than `0x1f`, and the DPI read uses the no-store byte (`0x00`)
where the V3 Pro reads with the storage byte. The transaction id and the command
table below were confirmed on hardware (`1532:008a`):

1. The model and wired state appear, with no battery column (wired-only; the
   mouse answers no battery query).
2. DPI reads back correctly and the control offers 100–8500 DPI.
3. A DPI change alters pointer speed and persists after reload, confirming the
   write-with-storage (`0x01`) / read-with-no-store (`0x00`) pairing.
4. Polling rate reads 125/500/1000 Hz, a 1000 Hz write round-trips with status
   `0x02`, and the rate persists.
5. No lift-off distance buttons and no sensor processing card appear.

| Read | Class / ID | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Firmware | `0x00` / `0x81` | transaction id `0xff` |
| Serial | `0x00` / `0x82` | ASCII, null terminated; transaction id `0xff` |
| DPI | `0x04` / `0x85` | no-store byte `0x00`, then big-endian X and Y |
| Polling | `0x00` / `0x85` | divisor of 1000; wired only |

| Write | Class / ID | Notes |

| DPI | `0x04` / `0x05` | storage byte `0x01`, then big-endian X and Y |
| Polling | `0x00` / `0x05` | divisor of 1000 |
| Off / Static / Spectrum / Reactive / Breathing | `0x0f` / `0x02` | extended matrix effects, transaction id `0x3f` |

Lighting goes through the extended-matrix effect family (`0x0f`/`0x02`) with the
storage byte, the logo led (`0x04`), and the effect id in the first three
argument bytes. The payloads are taken from openrazer's
`razer_chroma_extended_matrix_effect_*` functions, which the Viper Mini driver
dispatches every `*_common` mode write through, and match the daemon's
`MATRIX_DIMS = [1, 1]` single-zone layout. Effect commands have no read back, so
they are confirmed against the driver source rather than by read-back: the
single-colour breathing payload places the colour count (`0x01`) at argument 3
and a second `0x01` at argument 5, while dual puts `0x02` in both, and reactive
carries its speed level between them.

The 8500 DPI ceiling comes from the openrazer daemon class. The DPI step
granularity is assumed to be whole values, matching the V3 Pro driver.

## Cobra (verified on hardware)

The Cobra (`1532:00a3`) is driven by its own client in `cobra-hid.ts`, modelled
on the Viper Mini driver. The transaction id and the command table below were
confirmed on hardware:

1. The model and wired state appear, with no battery column (wired-only).
2. DPI reads back correctly and the control offers 100–8500 DPI.
3. A DPI change persists across a reload, confirming the write-with-storage
   (`0x01`) / read-with-no-store (`0x00`) pairing.
4. Polling rate reads and writes at 125/500/1000 Hz and persists.
5. Every extended-matrix effect answers on transaction id `0x1f`, including
   breathing — the one anomaly below is confirmed, not just assumed.

| Read | Class / ID | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Firmware | `0x00` / `0x81` | transaction id `0xff` |
| Serial | `0x00` / `0x82` | ASCII, null terminated; transaction id `0xff` |
| DPI | `0x04` / `0x85` | no-store byte `0x00`, then big-endian X and Y |
| Polling | `0x00` / `0x85` | divisor of 1000; wired only |

| Write | Class / ID | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DPI | `0x04` / `0x05` | storage byte `0x01`, then big-endian X and Y |
| Polling | `0x00` / `0x05` | divisor of 1000 |
| Off / Static / Spectrum / Reactive / Breathing | `0x0f` / `0x02` | extended matrix effects, transaction id `0x1f` |

Lighting reuses the same extended-matrix effect family (`0x0f`/`0x02`) as the
Viper Mini, with the storage byte, the logo led (`0x04`), and the effect id in
the first three argument bytes. Unlike the Viper Mini, whose effects all answer
on `0x3f`, every Cobra effect answers on `0x1f`.

The one anomaly in the reference is confirmed on hardware: openrazer lists the
Cobra's breathing writes on `0x3f`, inside a block of classic-matrix mice whose
other effects also use `0x3f`, but every other Cobra effect answers on `0x1f`
and breathing does too, so the single `0x1f` choice holds.

Brightness is not implemented: this driver covers effects and colour only.
